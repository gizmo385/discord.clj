# discord.clj

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Most new development on this project is happening on the [version 3.0 branch](https://github.com/gizmo385/discord.clj/tree/version3.0), which has support for interactions (slash commands, user/message commands) as well as message components. However, that branch does include a large number of changes that I believe simplify the library overall, but are indeed breaking changes for existing extensions.

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/discord.clj.svg)](https://clojars.org/discord.clj)

discord.clj is a [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) wrapper around the [Discord
APIs](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro). This library was written to ease in the
creation of Discord bots in Clojure.

The goal is to implement a [fully-compliant](https://gist.github.com/meew0/bbbbd5348967dee5f7e84c0cd58983fd) Discord API wrapper. This library is heavily influenced by [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py). I'm working on constantly improving the feature set in this library would welcome contributors who want to help make that a reality :)!
